# Face-Mask-Detection
Developed a machine learning model using lightweight  neural network MobileNetV2 to detect faces followed by a  classifier trained to identify if persons are wearing masks or  not. Our solution uses neural networking models to analyze  Real-Time Streaming Protocol video streams using OpenCV.
